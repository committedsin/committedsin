 byi ` BEFORE YOU INTERACT .
</h1>
!- i'd prefer if you'd whisper to interact , i am mostly offtab/afk. 

!- i adore c+h and wouldn't mind at all, no need to ask! specifically becuase i have a tc [touch comfort].  <- this excludes dniu_

!- i like to move around a lot, mostly during long c+h sessions. please don't mind me interacting with someone else or doing something stupid.

!- note that i get uncomfortable if you mention NSFW jokes when you're a stranger to me.

!- i get anxious sometimes and might have a hard time interacting, though i love conversations. just not when i start them ^_^
