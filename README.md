## byi ` BEFORE YOU INTERACT .

!- i'd prefer if you'd whisper to interact , i am mostly offtab/afk. 

!- i adore c+h and wouldn't mind at all, no need to ask! specifically becuase i have a tc [touch comfort].  <- this excludes dniu_

!- i like to move around a lot, mostly during long c+h sessions. please don't mind me interacting with someone else or doing something stupid.

!- note that i get uncomfortable if you mention NSFW jokes when you're a stranger to me.

!- i get anxious sometimes and might have a hard time interacting, though i love conversations. just not when i start them ^_^

## dni ` DO NOT INTERACT

!- basic dni critera, thats it feel free to interact otherwise.. keep in mind i block freely.

## iwc ` INTERACT WITH CAUTION

!- HB/HH/TADC fandom [i have bad experiences with you guys.. sorry]

!- under 11 and over 19 [just a pref range its okay if you interact!]
